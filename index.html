        <p class="biodata-overview">As a fourth-semester student majoring in Informatics at Syiah Kuala University, I have recently gained several new experiences.
            Overcoming my introverted nature, which often made me hesitant to appear in public, despite my capability to do so, has been a
            significant achievement. Participating in the search for Informatics ambassadors and being selected as a representative has taught
            me a great deal, introducing me to remarkable individuals and fostering a positive environment that has allowed me to express
            myself more freely. Building on this, I have gained confidence to engage in various activities, such as serving as a committee
            member for Infest, the largest annual event for informatics students. In addition to my role as a committee member, I volunteered to
            be the MC at the closing ceremony of Infest. My profound interest lies in the field of computer networking, particularly in the realm
            of cybersecurity, which has motivated me to continuously learn and explore this field through various courses. My aspiration, upon
            acquiring expertise in cybersecurity, is to introduce the excitement and significance of this field to a wider audience. Moreover, I am
            also drawn to psychological aspects, as observing and understanding the unique behaviors of individuals is a fascinating topic for
            me, often serving as a supportive listener and exchange partner for my peers.</p>
